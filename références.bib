	abstract = {Three streams in the Piedmont ecoregion of North Carolina were studied to evaluate the effect of land use (forested, agricultural, urban) on water quality and aquatic biota. In comparison with the forested stream, there were few changes in water quality at the agricultural and urban streams. Suspended-sediment yield was greatest for the urban catchment and least at the forested catchment. Suspended-sediment concentrations during storm events followed this same pattern, but at low-moderate flows suspended-sediment concentrations were greatest at the agricultural site. Most nutrient concentrations were highest at the agricultural site, and the amount of ‘available’ dissolved nitrogen was elevated at both the urban and agricultural sites. High concentrations of metals (totals) in the water column were sometimes observed at all sites, but maximum average concentrations were recorded at the urban site (especially Cr, Cu, and Pb). Maximum sediment metal concentrations, however, were not found at the urban site, but were usually recorded at the forested site. Only minor differences were noted between fish communities of the forested and agricultural sites, although both abundance and average size of some species increased at the agricultural site. The fish community at the urban site was characterized by low species richness, low biomass, and the absence of intolerant species.},

	abstract = {▪ Abstract The world\&apos;s population is concentrated in urban areas. This change in demography has brought landscape transformations that have a number of documented effects on stream ecosystems. The most consistent and pervasive effect is an increase in impervious surface cover within urban catchments, which alters the hydrology and geomorphology of streams. This results in predictable changes in stream habitat. In addition to imperviousness, runoff from urbanized surfaces as well as municipal and industrial discharges result in increased loading of nutrients, metals, pesticides, and other contaminants to streams. These changes result in consistent declines in the richness of algal, invertebrate, and fish communities in urban streams. Although understudied in urban streams, ecosystem processes are also affected by urbanization. Urban streams represent opportunities for ecologists interested in studying disturbance and contributing to more effective landscape management.},

	abstract = {The Central Platte River often experiences high water temperatures during sunny, hot summer days. A 128-km reach of the Platte River downstream of two hydropower dams (Kingsley Dam and North Platte/Keystone Diversion Dam) was studied to determine the relationship between river summer water temperatures and river flow-rate, and the impacts of in-stream flow requirements upon peak water temperatures. This reach serves as a habitat for eight federally listed or endangered species, as well as over 300 species of migratory birds, including 500,000 sandhill cranes and 7-9 million ducks and geese. Hourly water temperatures were simulated using a dynamic numerical model (MNSTREM) with and without in-stream flow requirements. It was found that a clear relationship exists between river water temperatures and river flow-rate. In addition, it was found that the occurrence of high water temperatures can be attributed to low river flow-rate and can be reduced, but not eliminated, with minimum in-stream flow requirements.},

	abstract = {Ocean warming and acidification occur at global scales and, in the case of temperature, have already caused shifts in marine ecosystem composition and function. In the case of CO2-induced ocean hypercapnia and acidification, however, effects may still be so small that evidence for changes in the field is largely lacking. Future scenarios indicate that marine life forms are threatened by the specific or synergistic effects of factors involved in these processes. The present paper builds on the view that development of a cause and effect understanding is required beyond empirical observations, for a more accurate projection of ecosystem effects and for quantitative scenarios. Identification of the mechanisms through which temperature- and CO2-related ocean physicochemistry affect organism fitness, survival and success, is crucial with this research strategy. I suggest operation of unifying physiological principles, not only of temperature but also CO2 effects, across animal groups and phyla. Thermal windows of optimized performance emerge as a basic character defining species fitness and survival, including their capacity to interact with other species. Through effects on performance at the level of reproduction, behaviour and growth, ocean acidification acts especially on lower marine invertebrates, which are characterized by a low capacity to compensate for disturbances in extracellular ion and acid–base status and sensitivity of metabolism to such disturbances. Available data suggest that one key consequence of these features is a narrowing of thermal tolerance windows, as well as a reduced scope for performance at ecosystem level. These changes in bioenvelopes may have major implications for the ranges of geographical distribution of these organisms and in species interactions.},

	abstract = {Turbidity is widely regarded for modulating primary production and influencing the distribution of submerged aquatic vegetation. Although less well studied, turbidity can also have significant effects on trophic interactions and food webs by modifying light penetration and scattering, influencing foraging ability of visual-hunting predators such as fishes. By interfering with visual foragers, turbidity may shift food webs towards predators that forage with other sensory modalities (e.g. chemoreception and mechanoreception), consequently altering food web structure. We analysed turbidity effects on estuarine community composition and biodiversity in the Gulf of Mexico by analysing an 18-year fisheries-independent data set and assessing communities inhabiting contemporary oyster reefs (Crassostrea virginica). In the long-term data set, elevated turbidity was associated with decreased fish species richness and diversity and higher abundances of benthic species that rely more on chemoreception for foraging and predator avoidance (e.g. crabs). High turbidity may provide a predation refuge for crabs and other benthic organisms that visually oriented fish prey upon. On oyster reefs, crabs readily consume suspension-feeding organisms including newly settled oysters and porcelain crabs (Petrolisthes armatus). Both were significantly less abundant in high turbidity. Human practices that increase turbidity may indirectly influence trophic interactions, species distributions, ecosystem function, and biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Turbidity flows – underwater avalanches – are large-scale physical disturbances that are believed to have profound and lasting impacts on benthic communities in the deep sea, with hypothesized effects on both productivity and diversity. In this review we summarize the physical characteristics of turbidity flows and the mechanisms by which they influence deep-sea benthic communities, both as an immediate pulse-type disturbance and through longer-term press-type impacts. Further, we use data from turbidity flows that occurred hundreds to thousands of years ago as well as three more recent events to assess published hypotheses that turbidity flows affect productivity and diversity. We find, unlike previous reviews, that evidence for changes in productivity in the studies was ambiguous at best, whereas the influence on regional and local diversity was more clear-cut: as had previously been hypothesized, turbidity flows decrease local diversity but create mosaics of habitat patches that contribute to increased regional diversity. Studies of more recent turbidity flows provide greater insights into their impacts in the deep sea, but without pre-disturbance data, the factors that drive patterns in benthic community productivity and diversity, be they physical, chemical, or a combination thereof, still cannot be identified. We propose criteria for data that would be necessary for testing these hypotheses and suggest that studies of Kaikōura Canyon, New Zealand, where an earthquake-triggered turbidity flow occurred in 2016, will provide insights into the impacts of turbidity flows on deep-sea benthic communities as well as the impacts of other large-scale disturbances such as deep-sea mining.},
